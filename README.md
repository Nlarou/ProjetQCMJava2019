# ProjetQCM-Java
 
This code was made for a 2 weeks project for my Java class at La Cit√©.

The idea was to create a portal for a student and a professor. The professor can make exam with the questions and the student can take them.

# Lesson
 - Separate logic layer from interface layer to make the code more simple and readable
 - Optimisation by using more data structure
