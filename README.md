# ProjetQCM-Java
 
This code was made for a 2 weeks project for my Java class at La Cit√©.

The idea was to create a portal for a student and a professor. The professor can make exam with the questions and the student can take them.

Now that i have more experience i know that the way was not the best. Like to change the language instead of iterating throungh all the child i should have put them in a array at creation. Instead of using my principal interface to do a lot a operation, using a static class to handle that would be more easier and better i think.
